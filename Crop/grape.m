%                    *1 --> fixed in both Time & iDEPTH:

%                   This parameter can assume a value even if the crop is
%                   absent while in SWAP you can have an irrigation
%                   schedule only if the crop is present.
%                   Five parameters of seven must be defined according to
%                   the value assumed by V.flirri (see the '*' below to
%                   understand which one to configure).

%                        3: continuous dates defining h intervals [from,to]
%                     *iDEPTH:  amount of gross irrigation [cm].
%                     *cirr:    concentration of irrigation water ==> not implemented yet!
